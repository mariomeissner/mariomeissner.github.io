Let's have a look at how to build an LL(1) parser and what considerations we need to make when writing an LL(1) grammar.

For this post I assume basic knowledge about grammars and languages, but I try to be gentle.

# Motivation 
The lack of clear and concise information about this topic lead me to think that it could be useful for many people to have a small guide for it. What are the key contraints that an LL(1) grammar has? How to actually write a parser for a grammar you designed? The answers to these questions are actually quite simple, yet most sources I had looked up seemed to be either unclear, not very well focused, or difficult to find.

A secondary reason is that, having just finished my compiler course, I would like to write down some of my knowledge before I forget it all again after the summer break (summer breaks have this powerful and mysterious brain erasing capability, and I have yet to find a good way to fight against it).

# Definition of LL grammar and language

So what is an LL grammar anyway? It's a **subset of deterministic context-free grammars**, specifically those that can be parsed by an LL parser. This parser reads the input from **L**eft to right, and constructs the **L**eftmost derivation of whatever you are parsing. Note how the definition of LL grammar may sound a little bit obvious ("can be parsed by LL parser"). That is because giving a more precise definition is actially quite complex, as it is not easy to determine which grammars are LL and which not. I won't go into detail for this, since its not the purpose of this post.

An LL language is one that has an LL grammar to define it. Note that you can also use a non-LL grammar to define an LL grammar, but this is not convenient.

Our goal will be to define a grammar for our language that happens to be LL, such that we can benefit from the properties of it's parser. 

# Definition of LL parser

An LL parser is **predictive**, sometimes also called **recursive decent parser**. That is, if you follow a set of conditions such that your grammar is LL, you can make it so that your parser never has to backtracking and is dead simple to code by hand (as opposed to LR grammars). That's why the last part of this entry will cover how to write one. 

The big brother of an LL(1) parser is an LR(1) parser. Let's set things clear here before we move on: 

- LR(k) parsers can use backtracking if their number of lookahead tokens is not enough. 
- LR(1) parsers can parse **ANY** deterministic context free language (DCFL). They may do so by using backtracking if their one and only lookahead token is not enough to decide in some situations.
- LR(k) parsers use more than one lookahead token to be able to run in linear time in more situations. By arbitrary increasing this k, you can ensure linear time parsing for any DCFL.
- LL(k) parsers generally don't use backtracking; if they did, it would defeat their purpose, which is running fast and being really simple.
- LL(1) parsers can **ONLY** parse LL(1) languages.
- LL(2) parsers can parse LL(1) and LL(2) languages. 
- There is an infinite sequence of subsets of DCFLs as we increase the k in LL(k), none of them really ever reaching the whole set. 
- Thus, an LL(k+1) parser can parse strictly more grammars than an LL(k) parser.



# How to make an LL(I) grammar

If you have a language and want to attempt to make an LL(1) grammar for it (thus demonstrating that what you had is indeed an LL(1) language), there are several constraints that you have to follow when defining it. If all constraints apply, you successfully obtained an LL(1) grammar and you can move on to the next section to build a parser for it. 

The constraints are:

* No left recursions: (*X-> X...*)
* If you have several rules (*X->Y, X->Z*), then First(Y) \disjoint First(Z)
* If you have several rules (*X->Y, X->Z*), and First(Z) contains epsilon, then First(y) \disjoint Folloz(Z)
* If you have several rules (*X->Y, X->Z*), Z must be non-false
