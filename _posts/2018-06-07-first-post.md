So, I decided to start a blog. I always wanted to maintain one but the work that it would involve, together with the apparent low reward, always kept me away from doing so.

There are many reasons that could motivate someone to start a blog. Here I want to list a few that were the most influential for me.

## Training your writing skills

Not many people realize how important it is to be able to transmit written information in a clear and effective way. It's an invaluable skill and it should not be underestimated. If you are very knowledgeable but cannot transmit your thoughts very well, how will people acknowledge your potential?

Persuasion is one of the most powerful tools of a good communicator. Finding the right ideas and conveying them in the right way can get you very far. You can push things the way you want them to move. You can influence your environment. You can walk the path you want to walk.

## Making new connections

I am eager to find new people with similar interests to mine. The same way I enjoy commenting on other people's blogs and engage in stimulating discussions, I would love to someday receive comments from other readers and start to establish a network of valuable people.

## Building a curriculum

In your blog you can display your knowledge and experience. Future recruiters and scouters will have a better image if you since you appear to have more knowledge about a certain topic and know how to explain things to others.

## Forcing yourself to think more

When you have a new idea or understand a new concept, it always feels as if everything makes complete sense and the concept sits fully in your brain. In reality, this is rarely the case. As you continue thinking about it or attempt to explain it to someone else, you realize how full of holes the idea is.

By writing these things out and explaining them, it forces to think it through and thus helps you to solidify your knowledge. I would like to fill my knowledge wholes and learn more about the things I love by forcing myself to write about them.

## Be more organized, improve your lifestyle

Building healthy habits can get you in the mood to keep doing so. There is some kind of momentum effect to healthy habits that seems to be able to carry you through.

The days I do exercise, I immediately feel more motivated to continue doing productive and healthy activities. I will usually jump right into a study or reading session. I am looking forward to getting the same result from blogging.
