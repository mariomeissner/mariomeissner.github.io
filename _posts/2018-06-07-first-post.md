# Why I decided to start this blog

blabla


## Some fancy secondary header 

The reason why jekyll is cool is because I can easily add code snippets and write my posts with markdown.

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  print("Hi " + name)
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom'!.
{% endhighlight %}
